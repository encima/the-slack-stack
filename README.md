## The Slack(er) Stack
### aka Cloud Infrastructure for Beginners

> NOTE: This is an active WIP so check back for updates

This repo contains slides and scripts to introduce the design and deployment of performant, scalable architectures using Open Source Software and pain free deployments.

Feedback and PRs are welcome as the aim is to explain and demonstrate the following:

- Designing and scaling your infrastructure
- The functions of different Open Source Databases/Softwares:
  - PostgreSQL
  - ElasticSearch
  - Redis
  - Kafka
  - M3/InfluxDB
- Automating and simplifying deployment in a cloud agnostic way (using Aiven.io)
